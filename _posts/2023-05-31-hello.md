### *Here, I'm learning how to make webpages.*

Hopefully it evolves over time into a more centralized way to keep track of projects I've worked on.

But I mainly want to document them better!

<details>
    <summary>
        Why though?
    </summary>
    <blockquote>
        I want to be able to stylize my <code>README.md</code> files and GitHub wikis. That's really it to be honest.
    </blockquote>
</details>

*More projects to come in the future!*

I'll be making more pages and stuff over time (hopefully!)
