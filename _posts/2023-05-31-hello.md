### *Here, I'm learning how to make webpages.*

Hopefully it evolves over time into a more centralized way to keep track of projects I've worked on.

But I mainly want to document them better!

        Why though?

        I want to be able to stylize my <code>README.md</code> files and GitHub wikis. That's really it to be honest.

I'm currently learning C

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    if (argc == 1)
    {
        printf("Hi mom!\n");   
    }
    else
    {
        // Initialize i to 1 so we don't greet argv[0] a.k.a. the program executable!
        for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++)
        {
            printf("Hi %s!\n", argv[i]);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

*More projects to come in the future!*

I'll be making more pages and stuff over time (hopefully!)
