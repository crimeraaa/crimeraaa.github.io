#### *There's a certain cool factor to using the terminal effectively!*

Welcome to my dumbed-down interpretation of select commands from the `git` manual!

...because I easily forget stuff.

### About git

> What is `git`? How do I use it?

* `git` is a *version control system* for code. Basically, you can keep multiple versions of the same project!

* It's a command-line utility, so run it from your terminal window!

* This document assumes your remote `origin` is called, well, `origin`. 

> What if your remote isn't called `origin`?

* If you set it to something else, change instances of `origin` accordingly.

* To check what your origin is called, run `git remote -v`.

> `git remote -v` doesn't show anything!

* That means you haven't created a remote repository yet! 

> What's with those angled brackets, like in `<name>`?

* This just means the text and the angled brackets themselves must be replaced with your own input.

> What's a `.gitignore`?

* `.gitignore` is a *filetype* which `git` uses to know which files to **not commit**.

* Language-specific templates can be found in the [github/gitignore repository.][01-gitignore_templates]

<hr/>

## Basic Git Commands

`git init`

* Creates (i.e., initializes) a local `git` repository in your current working directory.

`git add <file> <...>`

* Adds specified file/s to be the staging area of your current directory.

* In other words it tells `git` *which* files to be committed.

* Requires at least 1 argument: `<file>`. `<...>` Means you can stage as many other files as you like. 

> What if I want to add all my files?
<!-- &lt; represents the < character and &gt; represents the > character. -->

* You can replace `<file>` with `.` to stage all files.

* If so, `.` will be the only argument.

* It will also not stage filetypes specified within your `.gitignore` file.

`git commit -m '<message>'`

* After running `git add`, this will actually commit (i.e. save) your changes to the local repository.

> What's `-m`? What's `<message>`?

* `-m` is required as all commits must have a message describing them.

* `<message>` must be enclosed in quotation marks.

## Global Commands

### Configuration

See the `.gitconfig` file for the parameters you can pass. Here are some of note:

| Field   | Members                | Description                                       |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `user`  | `user.name`            | The username displayed with your commits.         |
| `user`  | `user.email`           | The email with which commits are associated with. |
| `core`  | `core.editor`          | The filepath to your code editor of choice.       |
| `core`  | `core.excludesFile`    | The filepath to your Global `.gitignore` file.    |

Run `git config --global <member-name>` to see what its value is. For example:

```powershell
git config --global user.name
```

To set that member's value, add your value (enclosed quotations) after the member.

For example, let's say I want to see and set my global `.gitignore` file.

`git config --global core.excludesFile`

* Tells you the location of your current global `.gitignore` file.

`git config --global core.excludesFile "<your-file-path>"`

* Sets the global `.gitignore` file to whatever your input in `"<your-file-path>"`.

* This will save you the trouble of placing a `.gitignore` file in every repository!

* Best used for filetypes you're **absolutely certain** you never want to stage and commit.

### Setting a Global *.gitignore*

For example, I'm on Windows 10 and have a file named `GLOBAL.gitignore`. 
It's found in `C:\Users\crimeraaa\GLOBAL.gitignore`. 

> Do I need to call it `GLOBAL.gitignore`?

* Nope! This will also work if you simply create a nameless file.

* If you create a file just called `.gitignore`, as long as you specify that this is the file you're after, it will work.

* In that case, my filepath would be something like this: `C:\Users\crimeraaa\.gitignore`

<hr/>

The following examples assume you placed your file in the following directories.

| System  | Directory                 | A.K.A.         |
|---------|---------------------------|----------------|
| *NIX    | `~/`                      | Home Directory |
| Windows | `C:\Users\your-username\` | User Profile   |

#### Bash

```bash
git config --global core.excludesFile `~/GLOBAL.gitignore`
```

#### Windows Command Prompt

<!-- I'm pretty sure Windows Command Prompt is separate from the Batch scripting language, but whatever... -->

```batch
git config --global core.excludesFile "%USERPROFILE%\GLOBAL.gitignore"
```

#### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
git config --global core.excludesFile "$Env:USERPROFILE\GLOBAL.gitignore"
```

> Did you know that PowerShell supports some Bash-like syntax?

* Using `$HOME` or `~` means the same thing as `$:Env:USERPROFILE`. All of these are case *insensitive.*

* Do note that PowerShell doesn't recognize `%USERPROFILE%`.

<hr/>

## Push and Pull Commands

`git push origin`

* Pushes your current working branch to the main branch found at `origin`.

`git push origin <local-branch>:<remote-branch>`

* Pushes your `<local-branch>` to the specified `<remote-branch>` found in `origin`.

## Local Branch Commands

`git branch <name>`

* Creates a new branch of your specified `<name>`.

* Fails if `<name>` is already an existing branch.

`git branch -v`

* Shows you all existing local branches.

> What's `-v`?

* `-v` means `--verbose`, which just makes it output more info.

[whats-dash-v]:#local-branch-commands
    
`git checkout <name>`

* Sets your current working branch to your local `<name>` branch.

* Fails if `<name>` is not an existing branch.

<hr/>

## Remote Branch Commands

`git remote -v`

* Tells you where your branch is remotely hosted. 

> What's `-v`?

* `-v` means `--verbose`. See [`git branch -v`.][whats-dash-v]

`git branch -v -a`

* Shows you all existing local and remote branches.

> What's `-v`? What's `-a`?

* The parameters are optional, but I find them handy.

* `-v` means `--verbose`. See [`git branch -v`.][whats-dash-v]

* `-a` will show you all available local and remote branches.

`git checkout origin`

* This will check out the main branch found in `origin`.

`git checkout origin/<remote-branch-name>`

* This will check out the specified `<remote-branch-name>` found in `origin`.

***Remember to use `/` and not `:`!***
* To exit, run the checkout command again on a local branch name. 

Example:
```powershell
git checkout master
```
Where `master` is the exact name of a local branch we want to check out.
